# Tracking_Needle_Holder
Project “Tracking of the Needle holder”
▪ 3D Tracking of Needle Holder Trajectory During Surgery.
▪ Primary Goal: Object Detection and Trajectory Tracking of
the Needle Holder Tip
− Data: Stereo images from an embedded vision system
− Detection of colored objects within the surgical scene
− 3D-Reconstruction, orientation of needle holder rod
− Use marker on the plan of the medical scene picture as
coordinate origin.
− Track the trajectory of the needle holder tip and annotate
the orientation vector of the rod at each position.
